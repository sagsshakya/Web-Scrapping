      "The Company is in it's infancy, white boards and work flow charts along with extensive internal market research and my own experience. I am seeking specifically a partner who will compliment my shortcomings in the tech side of this venture. I have the vision, the drive, and the finances to fund the launch. The company is a software/HR/supplemental hiring company that will be web based to be used by companies such as Indeed, Careerbuilder and the U.S. government for candidates seeking employment/job surfing. It is designed to bridge a missing link within the hiring process for the private sector. The reason this gap exists is because of the lack the lack of skilled employees in today's market place among virtually all industries. The secondary function relates specifically to unemployment for the government. This platform is designed to save business' and the tax payers both time and huge sums of money. Preliminary numbers from within my industry assume 10-18k per year per company. Larger scale companies such as law and finance stand to save in excess of 30k annually as a result. Billable's for this company are to be generated first by ad traffic, and by annual subscription. With nearly 28 MILLION registered business' in the US, the market for this is very real, and the demand high. I personally struggle with what this problem would solve daily, and a lot of my colleagues agree we have a real problem.  Add to that the nearly 6 MILLION people (which by the way is VERY LOW historically) on unemployment and the vision suddenly transcends my wildest dreams for opportunity.  I'd be willing to explore other avenues of revenue generation outside of the ones I am currently aware of.\n",
